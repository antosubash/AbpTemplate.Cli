# AbpTemplate.Cli

The CLI for you ABP app. This repo is a work in progress. I will be adding more features to this CLI. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to create an issue. If you want to contribute, please feel free to create a PR. I will be happy to review it. Thanks.

## What is this?

This is a CLI for ABP Application. you can use this to connect to you ABP application and perform some actions. For example, you can create a tenant, create a user, create a role, etc.

## Why?

I have been working on ABP for a while now. I have been using the ABP CLI to create new modules, services, etc. But I have been missing a CLI to connect to my ABP application and perform some actions. So I decided to create one.

## Features

- [x] Login
- [x] Logout
- [x] Switch tenant
- [x] Seed Tenant (Randomly generate tenant name, admin user, admin password, etc.)
- [x] Seed User (Randomly generate user name, password, etc.)
- [ ] Import and Export data (Maybe)

> Note: if you are wondering Import from where, I am planning to use a csv file to import and export data.
